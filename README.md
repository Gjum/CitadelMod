# Citadel Mod

Display reinforcement info on the faces of blocks.

A Fabric/Forge mod for [CivClassic](https://github.com/CivClassic) and other Civ servers.

Inspired by Shadowtrot's [reinforcement overlay](https://github.com/caucow/RandomCodeAndProjects/blob/main/CmdReinforcement.java#L178).

Reinforcement types are indicated by the corner colors:

- Stone: purple
- Iron: white
- Diamond: blue
- Paper: green
- Bedrock: black

Stone/Iron/Diamond colors are the same sa the particles when reinforcing.
